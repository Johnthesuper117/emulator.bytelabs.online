# BYTELABS Arcade (Emulator Archive)

This is a small static site for listing and launching games (both built-in web games and ROMs via EmulatorJS).

Features
- Searchable game archive (fuzzy search by title and tags)
- Built-in browser games (Snake, Tetris, Breakout, Dungeon Quest, Memory Match)
- Per-game pages and an emulator launcher for ROMs
- Drag-and-drop and file upload support for ROMs
- Persist last selected console/core in localStorage

How to run locally

1. Start a static server from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

How to use
- Search: Use the search box on the homepage to find games by name or tag (e.g., "mario", "pokemon", "snake").
- Built-in games: Matching built-in games (tagged `built-in`) will run in the terminal area directly.
- ROM games: Selecting a ROM-backed entry will open a per-game page; click PLAY to open the emulator launcher.
- Emulator launcher: On `emulator.html` you can
  - Select the console/core (last selected core is saved in localStorage)
  - Paste a ROM URL
  - Or drag-and-drop / upload a ROM file
  - Click Launch to attempt to run the ROM. If EmulatorJS is included on the page, the launcher will try to initialize it; otherwise a download/open link is shown.

Notes
- This is a static demo. Uploaded ROMs are handled in-browser via blob URLs (they are not uploaded to the server).
- To run ROMs directly in-browser, include an EmulatorJS bundle/script on `emulator.html` and ensure its public API matches the simple calls attempted in `js/emulator.js`.

If you want, I can integrate a specific EmulatorJS build (provide a CDN/script URL) and wire the exact loading API so pasted/uploaded ROMs run in-page.
